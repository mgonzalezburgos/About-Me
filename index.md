Alrighty friends. As much as I would love to get philosophical in this little bio, I think we've all gotten to know each other quite well this semester and I'm down to my last functioning brain cell. Ask me again next week when I tackle this page for extra credit.

One might argue that for the vast majority of us this course has served as our court mandated therapy, if by court we mean T&T and by therapy we mean our procedural requirements. 

All jokes aside, despite this course having so many challenges, I can safely say it's been the one that we've looked forward to the most, as it's served to channel our stress and anxieties of daily lives, and turn them into something productive and useful for our respective research paths. I think that, had I taken this in year 1, my experience would've been much different and I might not have been as productive as I was this year, as I was still trying to find myself as a T&T researcher, I was fairly confident I'd end up somewhere within Digital Media or the Digital Humanities, but my future seemed murky at best. Now, as a more grounded scholar with better direction, I've been able to use what I've learned here to better myself as I make my way towards candidacy, dissertation, conference presentation and, eventually, defense.
